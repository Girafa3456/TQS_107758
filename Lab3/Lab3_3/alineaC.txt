# Advantages:

    -> Realistic Testing: Ensures tests reflect actual production conditions and DB-specific behavior (e.g., SQL syntax, constraints).
    
    -> Uncovers DB-related Issues: Identifies bugs that may only appear with the actual database engine.
    
    -> Production-like Environment: Mimics the production setup, reducing discrepancies between testing and deployment environments.
    
    -> Integration with Services: Helps confirm smooth interactions with other services depending on the real database.

# Disadvantages:

    -> Slower Performance: Real databases are slower than in-memory options like H2, affecting test execution time.
    
    -> Test Isolation Issues: Data contamination can occur if not managed properly, making tests unreliable.
    
    -> Resource Management: Requires a running database instance, adding complexity to the setup and maintenance.
    
    -> Database Downtime Risks: Test failures can happen if the database is unavailable during tests.
    
    -> Harder to Reset State: More complex to clean and restore the database state between tests.
