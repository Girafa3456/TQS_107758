Analyze the results report and try to answer the following questions:

• What metrics are contributing the most to the frontend perceived performance? What do
they mean?


R:  FCP (First Contentful Paint)    -> Time until the first text or image appears on the screen.
    SI (Speed Index)                ->  Time until the largest visible element (e.g., hero image, heading) loads.
    LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)  -> How quickly all visible parts of the page display (average time for pixels to paint).
    TBT (Total Blocking Time)       -> Total time the main thread was blocked (preventing user input) between FCP and interactivity.
    CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)   -> Unexpected movement of page elements (e.g., text shifting when an image loads).

• How would you make the site more accessible?

R:
Audits all metrics
Simulates real-world conditions (3G, mobile).
Checks accessibility alongside performance.
